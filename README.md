## Preventing Backend Cold Starts
The backend is hosted on Render Free Tier and may go to sleep after short inactivity.  
We have implemented a keep-alive solution using [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org/) to ping the backend every 1 minute:

- URL: https://eduhaven-backend.onrender.com/
- Interval: Every 1 minute
- Purpose: Prevents backend cold starts for faster response times.

For full details, see [`KEEP_ALIVE.md`](KEEP_ALIVE.md).
